    "text": "The problem states:\nA bunny starts at \\((0,0)\\) in the coordinate plane and makes a series of hops. The bunny wants to get to a carrot at \\((1,0)\\).\nThe bunny only has 8 choices for each hop. If its current location is \\((x,y)\\), its next hop must be to one of the following 8 points, much like how a knight moves on a chessboard, except 24 units in one direction and 7 units in a perpendicular direction.\n\\((x+24,y+7)\\), \\((x+24,y-7)\\), \\((x-24,y+7)\\), \\((x-24,y-7)\\), \\((x+7,y+24)\\), \\((x+7,y-24)\\), \\((x-7,y+24)\\), \\((x-7,y-24)\\)\n\n\nThe Solution\nConsider \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) independently first:\nFor \\(x\\): we need a total displacement of +1 (from \\(x=0\\) to \\(x=1\\)). We can either move \\(\\pm 24\\) or \\(\\pm 7\\). Let’s call the number of 24-unit hops “\\(a\\)”, with the sign indicating direction (\\(a=-4\\) would mean that we took 4 24-unit hops to the left)*. Similarly, let’s call the number of 7-unit hops “\\(b\\)”. Let’s invert the direction of \\(b\\) (meaning \\(b=3\\) would represent 3 7-unit hops to the left). The reason for this is a matter of convenience. Because the number of 24-unit hops and 7-unit hops will always be opposite signed of each other (in order to result in a net sum of 1), inverting one of them allows us to state that the total number of hops is: \\(|a+b|\\).\n*The number of hops in this case does not account for any opposing hops that would “cancel” each other out. 2 24-unit hops to the right + 2 24-unit hops to the left will be represented as \\(a=0\\). Similarly, 4 7-unit hops to the right, followed by 2 7-unit hops to the left will be represented as \\(b=2\\).\nBecause we can always “cancel” out a hop to the right with a hop to the left, our total number of hops can always have an arbitrary number of twos added to it. Since we are looking for a net displacement of +1, let’s set up an equation as follows:\n\\[24a-7b=1\\]\n\\[\\text{Total number of hops} = |a+b|+2k \\text{ where } k \\text{ is an arbitrary non-negative integer.}\\]\nFor \\(y\\): we need a total displacement of 0 (from \\(y=0\\) to \\(y=0\\)). Let’s follow the precedent above, but the number of 24-unit hops will be represented by \\(c\\), and the number of 7-unit hops will be represented by \\(d\\). A positive value of \\(c\\) will represent a hop “up”. The direction of \\(d\\) will be inverted, similar to \\(b\\). This gives us the following equations:\n\\[24c-7d=0\\]\n\\[\\text{Total number of hops} = |c+d|+2k \\text{ where } k \\text{ is an arbitrary non-negative integer.}\\]\nBased on the need for a vertical displacement of 0, there are three possible scenarios:\n\nThere are an even number of either 24-unit or 7-unit hops that cancel themselves out (e.g. 3 24-unit hops up + 3 24-unit hops down). This would give us:\nTotal hops \\(= 0 + 2k\\) where \\(k\\) is an arbitrary non-negative integer. (Total hops could be any even, positive integer.)\nSome number of 24-unit hops is canceled out by some number of 7-unit hops in the opposite direction. Since 24 and 7 are relatively prime, this would have to involve \\(c\\) being some multiple of 7, and \\(d\\) being some multiple of 24. This possibility gives us:\nTotal hops \\(= 24k+7k\\) where \\(k\\) is an arbitrary non-negative integer. This simplifies to Total hops \\(= 31k\\). (Total hops could be any multiple of 31).\nA combination of both of the above (e.g. 7 24-unit hops up + 24 7-unit hops down + 3 7-unit hops up + 3 7-unit hops down). This gives us:\nTotal hops \\(= 31k_1+2k_2\\) where \\(k_1\\) and \\(k_2\\) are arbitrary non-negative integers.\n\nFor the requirements of the \\(y\\) displacement, we can conclude that the total number of hops must be some multiple of 31 + some multiple of 2 (restricted to non-negative results).\nBack to \\(x\\):\nWe know that \\(24a-7b=1\\). We also know that the total number of hops can be measured by \\(|a+b|\\). Based on these, let’s make a table of possible values based on the integer solutions of the equation:\n\n\n\n\\(a\\)\n\\(b\\)\n\\(|a+b|\\)\n\n\n\n\n-23\n-79\n102\n\n\n-16\n-55\n71\n\n\n-9\n-31\n40\n\n\n-2\n-7\n9\n\n\n5\n17\n22\n\n\n12\n41\n53\n\n\n19\n65\n84\n\n\n26\n89\n115\n\n\n\nFrom the table, we can see that as \\(a\\) increases/decreases, so does \\(b\\), therefore any value of \\(|a+b|\\) will increase as \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) go towards either extreme. From this, we can conclude that we have the set of the lowest possible number of Total Hops here, based on \\(x\\)-based restrictions, therefore if we find a working solution here and it is the lowest working solution of the bunch, then we have found the lowest working solution. (A note: the Total Hops could be \\(|a+b|+2k\\) where \\(k\\) is an arbitrary non-negative integer.)\nWe know that the number of \\(x\\) hops must match the number of \\(y\\) hops. Also, we know that for each 24-unit \\(x\\) hop, there must be a 7-unit \\(y\\) hop and vice-versa. This means that \\(|a|=|d|+2k\\) and \\(|b|=|c|+2k\\) where \\(k\\) is an arbitrary non-negative integer. We also know that if the number of hops is less than 31, the \\(y\\) hops must be made up of an even number of 24-unit “\\(c\\)” hops and an even number of 7-unit “\\(d\\)” hops (it would just be hopping back and forth). Essentially, if the number of hops is less than 31, we need an even number of 24-hops and an even number of 7-hops. Taking a look at our table, this doesn’t exist. All of our options less than 31 involve an odd number of either count \\((-2,-7),(5,17)\\). Because of this, let’s move to the next possible scenario, 31 or more hops:\nFor this case, in the \\(y\\) hops, we need \\(7k\\) 24-unit “\\(c\\)” hops, and \\(24k\\) 7-unit “\\(d\\)” hops (where \\(k\\) is an arbitrary non-negative integer) so that they can cancel each other out. Luckily, we can use the fact that we can always add pairs of 2 hops to the \\(x\\) hops (1 hop right, 1 hop left). Let’s add some extra “\\(a\\)” hops to the \\((-2,-7)\\) line. This leads us to a possible solution:\n\n\n\nnum of hops\ntype of hop\nnet effect\n\n\n\n\n13\n\\((-24,-7)\\)\n\\((-312,-91)\\)\n\n\n11\n\\((+24,-7)\\)\n\\((+264,-77)\\)\n\n\n7\n\\((+7,+24)\\)\n\\((+49,+168)\\)\n\n\ntotal\n31 hops\n\\((+1,+0)\\)\n\n\n\nEssentially we are adding to the \\((-2,-7)\\) line. It had 2 24-unit hops left and 7 7-unit hops right, and we add 11 24-unit hops to the right and to the left. This allows for us to get the number of \\(y\\)-hops we need to cancel themselves out, without changing the net \\(x\\) displacement. We use 24 7-unit hops down with 7 24-unit hops up to have a net \\(y\\) displacement of 0. Our lowest possible solution is 31 hops.\n\n\nLet’s test our solution experimentally!\nTo see if our solution is indeed the lowest, let’s set up a program to test it.\ndef main():\n    #starting positions\n    x=0\n    y=0\n    #num of hops\n    h=1\n    \n    #set of moves\n    moves=[(+24,+7),(+24,-7),(-24,+7),(-24,-7),\n           (+7,+24),(+7,-24),(-7,+24),(-7,-24)]\n    \n    visited=set({(0,0)})\n    newvisits=set({(0,0)})\n    \n    #testing hops up to 31\n    while h&lt;32:\n        print(\"testing \",h,\" hops\")\n        #move newvisits to thisvisited, so we can make a new clean newvisits\n        thisvisited=newvisits\n        newvisits=set({})\n        #for every new location, and for every hop from there\n        for (vx,vy) in thisvisited:\n            for (dx,dy) in moves:\n                #make the hop\n                x=vx+dx\n                y=vy+dy\n                #check for solution\n                if (x,y) == (1,0):\n                    print(\"solution found at \",h,\" hops!\")\n                    return()\n                #check if this is a new place\n                if (x,y) not in visited:\n                    visited.add((x,y))\n                    newvisits.add((x,y))\n                x=0\n                y=0\n        h+=1\n    return()\n\nmain()\nThe Results:\nThe output of the program confirms that the first solution it finds is at 31 hops. This corroborates what we found mathematically!"
